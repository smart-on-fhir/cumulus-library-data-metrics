          This has a few flaws, namely that it is imprecise.

          1. First off, it only promises to be "approx" in the first place.
            - Report of it being ~7% off here: https://github.com/trinodb/trino/discussions/22388
          2. If the series of values is even, it will pick a side, rather than average the middle.
             I think this _can_ be a definition of median? But it seems like the SQL world agrees
             that median is best defined with an interpolated value.

          But... it's good enough for our purposes. Not worth doing extra custom code.
